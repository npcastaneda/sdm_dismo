=========

These are R scripts for modeling the potential distribution of many species using the dismo package (Elith & Hijmans 2012).
Having defined environmental variables and occurrence points, the function allows the user to select which algorithms (MaxEnt, bioclim and mahalanobis distance, for now) and how many partitions for splitting the data in testing and training data.
